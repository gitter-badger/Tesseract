# Tesseract Graphics

Tesseract is a graphics library for ComputerCraft and possibly OpenComputers and (Dan's New Project) at some stage.

### How to install and use

Firstly, download a small OS that includes building tools: `pastebin run viz9UYXi`.

Next, clone the repo or download the zip. Make a new folder called `graphics` inside a CC computer folder, copy `src` and `setup` into it (`graphics/src` and `graphics/setup`), then copy everything from the `utils` folder into the root of the CC computer folder.

After that, enter the following commands into the shell:

```
cd graphics
build run setup
```

To run the code, type `build debug` into the shell (while cd'd into the `graphics` folder).
