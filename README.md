# Tesseract Graphics

Tesseract is a graphics library for ComputerCraft and possibly OpenComputers and (Dan's New Project) at some stage.

### How to install and use

First of all, clone the repo or download the zip. Pt the `src` folder into a folder called `graphics` in a CC computer folder. Then, copy everything from the `build` folder and put it in the CC computer folder.

After that, enter the following commands into the shell:

```
cp build graphics/build
cd graphics
build run setup
```

To run the code, type `build debug` into the shell (while cd'd into the `graphics` folder).
